# **Startup Success Prediction**  

This project aims to predict whether an operating startup will **succeed or fail**. Success is defined as the company achieving a **Merger & Acquisition (M&A)** or an **Initial Public Offering (IPO)**, providing substantial financial returns to its founders. Failure occurs when the startup **shuts down**.  

By leveraging machine learning, we analyze key factors influencing a startupâ€™s trajectory, helping to identify patterns that contribute to long-term success. ðŸš€ 
This prediction can assist **investors** in making informed decisions about whether to invest in a startup or not. ðŸ’¡ðŸ’°
